# Week 45 - Radio Stations

The data this week comes from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_radio_stations_in_the_United_States). 

The dataset included was mined from all 50 states, tidying column names, binding and aggregating.

## Density of radio stations

This week I made my first ever cartogram, which shows the amount of radio stations per 1000 inhabitants in different US states.
I took the population of different states from Wikipedia.
